// Create your "classes" here.

// You need Rect, Circle, and Logo classes.
// They can all inherit from a DisplayObject class.

// The constructors for these classes should all take in
// an object full of options. Look at the data- attributes
// in objects.html to see what those options are.

// Each class should have a draw method that takes in a
// canvas context. Use the functions in helpers.js to do
// the actual drawing. Those functions take in a context
// and an object of options. All three functions require
// x and y options, but they vary after that.
